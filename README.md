## 1. About

Each year I create a digital version of the [Scottish Episcopal Church calendar and lectionary](http://www.scotland.anglican.org/who-we-are/publications/liturgies/calendar-and-lectionary/) for importing into an electronic calendar, such as Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, Apple iCal, etc.

The website can be found at http://www.seccalendar.org.uk/.
