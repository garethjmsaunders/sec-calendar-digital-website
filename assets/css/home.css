/* === 1. BASE =============================
"Base rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively
single element selectors but it could include attribute
selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling
selectors. Essentially, a base style says that wherever
this element is on the page, it should look like this." (SMACSS, p.6)
*/



/* === 2. LAYOUT ===========================
"Layout rules divide the page into sections. Layouts hold
one or more modules together." (SMACSS, p.7)
*/



/* === 3. MODULES ==========================
"Modules are the reusable, modular parts of our design.
They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product
lists and so on." (SMACSS, p.7)
*/



/* === 4. STATE ============================
"State rules are ways to describe how our modules or
layouts will look when in a particular state. Is it hidden
or expanded? Is it active or inactive? They are about describing
how a module or layout looks on screens that
are smaller or bigger. They are also about describing
how a module might look in different views like the
home page or the inside page." (SMACSS, p.7)
*/



/* === 5. THEME ============================
"Theme rules are similar to state rules in that
they describe how modules or layouts might look. Most
sites donâ€™t require a layer of theming but it is good to be
aware of it." (p.7)
